## How did I use to write?

First, with .yellow-h[Excel + Word], I was ...

- frustrated with Word
    - formatting tables, figures, citations, and equations 
    - managing references
    
- tired of switching between programmes/screens
    - and, worried about making mistakes in between
    
- used the .red-h[illegal] version

Then, with .yellow-h[OpenOffice + R + LaTeX], I was ...

- ~~frustrated with Word~~
    - ~~formatting tables, figures, citations, and equations~~ 
    - ~~managing references~~

- ~~used the .red-h[illegal] versione~~

- tired of switching between programmes/screens
    - and, worried about making mistakes in between
    
- converting PDF documents to Word manually
    - coordinating work with co-authors who don't use LaTeX/PDF
    - submitting to journals which don't accept LaTeX/PDF

## How do I write now?

Now, with .yellow-h[R Markdown], I am ... happy!

- ~~frustrated with Word~~
    - ~~formatting tables, figures, citations, and equations~~ 
    - ~~managing references~~
    
- ~~tired of switching between programmes/screens~~
    - ~~and, worried about making mistakes in between~~
    
- ~~used the .red-h[illegal] versione~~

- ~~converting PDF documents to Word, manually~~
    - ~~coordinating work with co-authors who don't use LaTeX/PDF~~
    - ~~submitting to journals which don't accept LaTeX/PDF~~

## R Markdown

- Efficient

   - write text, cite sources, tidy data, analyse, table, and plot it in one programme/screen
   - re-do one, more, or all of these with ease
       - decrease the possibility of making mistakes in the process
       
--

- Flexible

    - output to various formats
        - e.g., HTML, LaTeX, PDF, Word
        
--

- Open access/source

   - use for free
   - create documents accessible to anyone with a computer and internet connection
   - benefit from the work of a great community of users/developers

## Reproducibility &mdash; Before Publication

- Having written a complete draft

    - with data including re-coded variables, tables, figures, and text with references to specific results (e.g., numbers from summary and/or regression statistics)

--

- If you and/or your co-authors decide 

    - to reverse a re-coded variable to its previous/original measure
    - and/or, to exclude a subgroup of observations from analysis

--

- How resource intensive would this revision be?

    - how long would this revision take?
    - how many programmes would be needed for this revision, and how much would they cost?
    - there is an inverse relationship between this resource intensity and reproducibilty

## Reproducibility &mdash; After Publication

- After your paper is published, if others, including your future self, would like to test how robust the results are

    - to reversing a re-coded variable to its previous/original measure
    - and/or, to excluding a subgroup of observations from analysis

--

- How resource intensive would this test be?

    - how accessible is the data, documentation (how was the variable re-coded in the first place?), and the code?
    - how long would the test take?
    - how many programmes would be needed for this revision, and how much would they cost?
    - there is an inverse relationship between this resource intensity and reproducibilty

## R Markdown Document &mdash; Compile

.pull-left-c[
- Click the `Knit` button to compile your .Rmd document, and observe that 

  - the output document has the same name as your .Rmd document

- You may want to delete these newly created files, as we will work with `journals.Rmd` instead to save time.

.inline-c[@bennett2015] becomes .out-t[Bennett (2015)]

.inline-c[[-@bennett2015]] becomes .out-t[(2015)]

.inline-c[-@bennett2015] becomes .out-t[2015]

.inline-c[[@bennett2015 35]] becomes .out-t[(Bennett, 2015, p. 35)]
